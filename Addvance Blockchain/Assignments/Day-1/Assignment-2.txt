1.	International banking crisis with the collapse of the investment in 2008.
Sol:-
The financial crisis of 2007â€“2008, also known as the global financial crisis (GFC), was a severe worldwide financial crisis. Excessive risk-taking by banks.
Culminating with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, and an international banking crisis.
The crisis sparked the Great Recession, which, at the time, was the most severe global recession since the Great Depression.
U.S. home mortgage debt relative to GDP increased from an average of 46% during the 1990s to 73% during 2008, reaching $10.5 trillion. The increase in cash out refinancings, as home values rose, fueled an increase in consumption that could no longer be sustained when home prices declined.
Lack of investor confidence in bank solvency and declines in credit availability led to plummeting stock and commodity prices in late 2008 and early 2009.
Economies worldwide slowed during this period since credit tightened and international trade declined. Housing markets suffered and unemployment soared, resulting in evictions and foreclosures. Several businesses failed. From its peak in the second quarter of 2007 at $64.4 trillion, household wealth in the United States fell $14 trillion, to $50.4 trillion by the end of the first quarter of 2009, resulting in a decline in consumption, then a decline in business investment.
